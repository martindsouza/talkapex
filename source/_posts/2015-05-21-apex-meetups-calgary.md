One of the popular things these days in the APEX community is to have localized [APEX Meetups](http://apexmeetups.com/). These are usually monthly meetings where one, or a few, people give a presentation about APEX. These are a lot more informal than traditional conferences and help the community grow in a given area.

I recently launched the Calgary APEX Meetup group: [ORCLAPEX-YYC](http://www.meetup.com/orclapex-YYC/). If you live in or around Calgary and are interested in getting together once a month to hear more about APEX join this group! The plan is to host our first Meetup in early June and are currently looking for a venue to host us. If you can acquire some space please leave a comment on the [discussion board](http://www.meetup.com/orclapex-YYC/messages/boards/thread/48970051).

We're looking to keep these events free and are always looking for sponsors to help fund some of the small costs. If you or your organization is interested please leave a comment on the&nbsp;[discussion&nbsp;board](http://www.meetup.com/orclapex-YYC/messages/boards/thread/48970066).
