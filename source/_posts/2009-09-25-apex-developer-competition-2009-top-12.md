Yesterday I found out that the application I submitted for the Oracle Application Express Developer Competition 2009 finished in the top 12! You can view all the winners here: [http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/database/application_express/html/comp_winners.html](http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/database/application_express/html/comp_winners.html)

You can read about my application here: [http://apex-smb.blogspot.com/2009/09/apex-rules-guidelines.html](http://apex-smb.blogspot.com/2009/09/apex-rules-guidelines.html). There's a link where you can download a copy of it as well. 

I put together my application rather quickly in a weekend so it does have some bugs. I'll try to update it soon for those that are using / interested in using it in their organization.

Thank you to all the judges and congrats to everyone that participated!
