Hi,

Well this isn't an APEX specific post but I thought it should be mentioned either way. It raises a good point about keeping test data out of production.

I got the following email from a colleague today: 

"<span style="font-style:italic;">I’m a bit of a golf fan, and I like to read up on current events, standings, player profiles, etc.  My favorite site to do this is [www.pgatour.com](http://www.pgatour.com)

I was recently searching for a player with the surname of Fischer on the website.  I had a good laugh when the search results came back.  Take a look at the 6th name in the list in the attached image…</span>"

Here's the screenshot:
