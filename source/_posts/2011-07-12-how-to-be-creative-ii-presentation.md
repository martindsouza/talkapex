You can download the slides of the <span style="font-style:italic;">How to be Creative II</span> presentation that I gave at [ODTUG Kscope 11](http://www.kscope11.com) from the following link: [http://goo.gl/2MP9l](http://goo.gl/2MP9l) Please note that the slides have been modified for handout purposes (i.e. not the exact same that I showed in the presentation).

The slides should also be updated soon on the ODTUG Kscope Scheduler: [http://caat.odtug.com/ODTUG_registration_menu.html](http://caat.odtug.com/ODTUG_registration_menu.html)
