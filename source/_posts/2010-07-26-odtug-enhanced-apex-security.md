At [ODTUG  Kaleidoscope](http://www.odtugkaleidoscope.com/) I promised that I would post my slides from my presentation. Here is a copy of the [Enhanced APEX Security](http://files.clarifit.com/blogs/talkapex/odtug2010/enhanced_apex_security_odtug_web.pdf) presentation.

The two demo's can be found here:

I hope to post the slides from the other presentation, How to be Creative, sometime next week.
