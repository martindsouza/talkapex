On December 14th at 1:30 PM EST Chris Hritzuk and I will be taking part in an “Ask the ClariFit Experts” webinar hosted by my company, [ClariFit Inc](http://www.clarifit.com/). Leading up to the webinar the development team at ClariFit will be accepting APEX, SQL, and PL/SQL questions by email at _AskTheExperts@clarifit.com_. The plan is to choose a subset of questions from the list received and provide a live, step-by-step demonstration of the solution during the webinar. We’ll also be leaving some time at the end of the session to field any questions that come up during the webinar.
