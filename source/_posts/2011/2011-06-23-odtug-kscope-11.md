I'll be speaking at [ODTUG Kscope 11](http://www.kscope11.com) next week in Long Beach, California. I've attended this conference for the past three years and it's always been an amazing time. Some of the world's best Oracle and APEX developers will be there. One of the best things I found is that everyone is extremely friendly and very approachable.

Here are the talks that I'm giving this year:

[APEX 4 + HTML 5 = Awesome](http://kscope11.com/component/seminar/seminarslist#APEX 4 + HTML 5 = Awesome (Abstract ID:235779))
Tuesday June 28, 11:15 AM-12:15 PM, Room: 202C

<span style="font-style:italic;">HTML 5 consists of many new features which will make developersâ€™ jobs a lot easier and improve end-user experience. HTML 5 is currently under development but many browsers already support some of its features. APEX developers should be aware of these enhancements. This presentation will highlight some of the HTML 5 features and how to integrate them with your APEX application to produce stunning results.</span>

[How to Be Creative II](http://kscope11.com/component/seminar/seminarslist#How to Be Creative II (Abstract ID:235776))
Thursday June 30, 8:30 AM-9:30 AM, Room: 202B

<span style="font-style:italic;">This presentation will demonstrate how to leverage the APEX dictionary, along with existing plug-ins, to enhance your APEX applications. It will include how to automate monitoring of your application, improve testing capabilities, improve development time, and provide some tweaks to enhance end-user experience.</span>

If things work out I'll be giving away copies of the two books I co-authored ([Beginning Oracle
Application Express 4](http://goo.gl/NxHoF) and [Expert Oracle Application Express](http://goo.gl/tXm3P)) at each of my presentations (<span style="font-style:italic;">if this sounds like a bribe it is, especially for the Thursday morning presentation following the Wednesday night party :-)</span>. Hope to see you there!
