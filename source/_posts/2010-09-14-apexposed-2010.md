I'll be giving a few presentations this year at [APEX<span style="font-style:italic;">posed</span> 2010](http://www.odtugapextraining.com/dallas.html) in Dallas, Texas.

This will be my first  [APEX<span style="font-style:italic;">posed</span> 2010](http://www.odtugapextraining.com/dallas.html) event and I'm really excited to go since they're some excellent [presenters](http://www.odtugapextraining.com/instructors.htm) this year. If you're new to APEX this will be an excellent opportunity to learn from some of the best in the APEX community.

If you haven't already done so I encourage you to [register](http://www.odtugapextraining.com/register.htm) soon to take advantage of the early bird rates.

I'll be doing 2 presentations and participating in a workshop. I've included the abstracts for them below:

[APEX Plug-ins](http://www.odtugapextraining.com/presentations.html#APEXPlug): One of the most anticipated new features in APEX 4.0 is Plug-Ins which allows developers to declaratively extend existing functionality in APEX. This presentation will go over the different types of Plug-Ins and how to create them. Primary focus will be on Item, Process, and Region type Plug-Ins.

Creating your first Plug-In can be intimidating, especially for developers new APEX developers. Some tips to help with obstacles that developers may encounter will be discussed.

[Team Development](http://www.odtugapextraining.com/presentations.html#TeamDevelopment): Managing a development project can be a cumbersome activity without the right tools. Beginning with 4.0, APEX now includes a software development management tool that integrates with your APEX applications.

This presentation will go over these tools and how they can help manage the development life cycle of your APEX application.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Authentication Workshop</span>: I'll be participating in this workshop. Here is the abstract

Who are you, really?  This workshop will demonstrate many methods of answering that question, from built-in authentication schemes to custom single sign-on.  LDAP, RSA, home-grown.  We will provide methods to solve many common authentication requirements.
