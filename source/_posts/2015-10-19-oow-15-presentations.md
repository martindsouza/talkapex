If you're attending [Oracle OpenWorld 2015](https://www.oracle.com/openworld/index.html) this year here are a few links for presentations I'd recommend:

* [Open Source and Oracle Application Express [UGF4096]](https://events.rainfocus.com/oow15/catalog/oracle.jsp?search=UGF4096&amp;search.event=openworldEvent)
  * Sunday Oct 25 8:00am - Moscone South Room 300
  * Martin Giffy D'Souza
  * If you've ever thought about using open source applications or want to become more involved with open source development for your Oracle and APEX applications this presentation is for you.

* [The Objects of My Affection: Deploying Your APEX Applications&nbsp;[UGF10050]](https://events.rainfocus.com/oow15/catalog/oracle.jsp?search=UGF10050&amp;search.event=openworldEvent)
  * Sunday Oct 25 10:00am - Moscone South Room 300
  * Francis Mignault
  * Learn how to deploy your applications for testing, QA, and production. Also learn how supporting objects work, and see the new Oracle Application Express 5 features that will help you package and deploy your applications.

* [ODTUG Sunday Sessions](http://www.odtug.com/p/cm/ld/fid=175)

On Tuesday night there will be the [APEX meetup](http://www.talkapex.com/2015/09/apex-oow-2015-meetup.html). Don't get their too late since it fills up pretty quickly. We'll be in the basement.  

I'll also be filming some Periscope interviews for ODTUG. If you can't attend OOW then you'll want to follow the [ODTUG twitter account](https://twitter.com/odtug). This will be the first time ODTUG has ever done this and we'd appreciate your feedback. If there's someone you'd like to see interviewed during the conference please let me know below by leaving a comment on this post.

I look forward to seeing everyone there!
