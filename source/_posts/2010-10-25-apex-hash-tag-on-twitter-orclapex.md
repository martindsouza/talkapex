The old Oracle APEX hash tag on twitter was <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">#apex</span>. If you search for <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">#apex</span> on Twitter you get a lot of non Oracle APEX related topics as apex is a common name.

Today I proposed a new hash tag for Oracle APEX related content on Twitter. Thanks to [Scott Spendolini](http://spendolini.blogspot.com/) for coming up with the final name and [Dan McGhan](http://www.danielmcghan.us/) for providing feedback.
