Each year the Oracle APEX community gets together at Oracle Open World (OOW) to have a few beers and catch up. This is a great informal event and its your chance to network with a lot of people in the APEX community and meet some of the gurus and members of the core APEX development team.

We'll be having the annual APEX OOW Meetup at [Johnny Foleys](http://www.johnnyfoleys.com/) on Tuesday September 20th at 7:30 onwards. Please let us know if you're coming by signing up on the [Meetup for this event](http://www.meetup.com/ODTUGers/events/233289975/?a=socialmedia).

If it's your first time attending, we're in the basement and there will be dueling piano's. Show up early as it gets packed pretty!
