After several late nights of nerding I've finally submitted/completed my APEX application for the [APEX Developer Competition 2009](http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/database/application_express/html/competition.html).

<strike>You can demo and download the application here: [http://apex.oracle.com/pls/otn/f?p=46865](http://apex.oracle.com/pls/otn/f?p=46865)</strike>
_Note: Demo is no longer up and will not be supported._

This purpose of this application is to allow development teams to create an online Rules &amp; Guidelines development document. The template for this application is based on Patrick Cimolini's (Cayman Islands Government) presentation at [ODTUG](http://www.odtugkaleidoscope.com/).

The concept of the R&amp;G template is:

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Rule:</span> Follow 100% of the time
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Guideline:</span> Follow 90% of the time

<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Mandatory Headings:</span>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Rule/Guideline:</span> Active voice sentence.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Why:</span>Important for Team Buy-In

<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Optional Headings:</span>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Result:</span> Illustration of desired outcome
<span style="font-weight: bold;">How:</span> How the result is achieved.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Notes:</span> State the non-obvious
<span style="font-weight: bold;">See Also:</span> Point to related Rules and Guidelines

You can use this template for both APEX development and your PL/SQL standards. I've included the installation files in the demo application so feel <span style="font-weight: bold;">free</span> to install at your organization. If you are using it please post any comments/suggestions on this post and I'll try to write some updates.
