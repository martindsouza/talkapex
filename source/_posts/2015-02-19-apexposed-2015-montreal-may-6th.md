It's back!&nbsp;[APEXposed](http://www.odtug.com/apexposed2015?utm_source=link&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=martin) is coming back to Montreal this year for a 1 day event. This conference is lined with some [amazing speakers](http://www.odtug.com/apexposed2015_presenters?utm_source=link&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=martin)&nbsp;and will be your chance to learn lots on APEX 5, ORDS, and so much more.

They're a few things different with this year's conference when compared with previous years. The first, and biggest is that it's free, yes **FREE/GRATUIT,**&nbsp;for ODTUG members. For non members it's $150\. If you're not an ODTUG member and are looking to save a few bucks it's only $99 for a membership so it's definitely worthwhile to get a membership and then attend the event for free. So [sign up now](http://www.odtug.com/join-odtug?utm_source=link&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=martin) if you don't have a membership.

The second big change is that it's only one day instead of two. We think that this will make it easier for people in and around the Montreal area to commit to. The conference will still cover [a lot of great content](http://www.odtug.com/apexposed2015_presentations?utm_source=link&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=martin), it's just packed into one day this time.

Aussi, si vous êtes plus à l'aise avec la langue française, il y aura deux présentations en français.
