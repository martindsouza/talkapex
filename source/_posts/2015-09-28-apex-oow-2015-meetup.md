Each year the Oracle APEX community gets together at Oracle Open World (OOW) to have a few beers and catch up. This is a great informal event and its your chance to network with a lot of people in the APEX community and meet some of the gurus and members of the core APEX development team.

We'll be having the annual APEX OOW Meetup at [Johnny Foleys](http://www.johnnyfoleys.com/) on Tuesday, October 27th at 7:30 onwards. We've been their a few times now and it is a really fun night since they have duelling pianos later on in the evening. Don't show up too late or it may be tough to get in.
