Aside from the obvious, it’s been disappointing for a lot of people in our community seeing all the canceled conferences. Conferences are a great time to learn and meet new people. I was recently talking about this to [Adrian Png](https://twitter.com/fuzziebrain) and [Trent Schafer](https://twitter.com/trentschafer) and we decided to create a one-day mini conference called [APEX@Home](http://apexatho.me). Since our initial discussion others have gotten involved ([Joel Kallman](https://twitter.com/joelkallman), [Shakeeb Rahman](https://twitter.com/shakeeb), [Peter Raganitsch](https://twitter.com/peterraganitsch), and [Niels de Bruijn](https://twitter.com/nielsdb)) and it’s blown up into a full one day 24-hour conference - for FREE!

[APEX@Home](http://apexatho.me) will be a bit different from normal webinars in the sense that everyone will be presenting from the comfort and safety of their homes (thus the name, [APEX@Home](http://apexatho.me)). We can expect some interruptions from kids, pets, etc. and we’ll make the most of it.

Everything you need to know:

- **When**: Thursday April 16th starting at 00:01am EDT  going until 23:59pm EDT 
- **Where**: Subscribe at [apex.oracle.com/officehours](https://apex.oracle.com/officehours) so you can receive reminders for this special event.
- **Format**: Each talk will begin on the hour. They will be 45 mins followed by a moderated 10min Q&A then a 5 min break where the speakers will change.

The full schedule and links to talk can be found [here](http://apexatho.me). The schedule includes a link to add each talk that you want to attend to your calendar.

[APEX@Home](http://apexatho.me) is for the community, by the community. Please help spread the word to your friends, colleagues, schools, clients, etc!
