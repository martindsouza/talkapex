I've updated the [ClariFit From To Date Picker](http://apex-plugin.com/oracle-apex-plugins/item-plugin/clarifit-from-to-date-picker_154.html) APEX Plugin. There was a small bug in the initial version that caused rendering issues in IE.

The initial post about the plugin can be found [here](http://www.talkapex.com/2011/12/clarifit-fromto-date-picker-plug-in.html) and the [demo](http://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=45587:700:0) here.

Thanks to Marc B and Joni V for finding the issue.
