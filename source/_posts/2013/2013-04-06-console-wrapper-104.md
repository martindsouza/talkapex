Console Wrapper 1.0.4 is officially out. You can download it from the project page: [https://code.google.com/p/js-console-wrapper/](https://code.google.com/p/js-console-wrapper/)

The only change for this release was to resolve an IE 9/10 issue which I [previous blogged](http://www.talkapex.com/2013/03/console-wrapper-104-beta.html) about.

If you're using any of the [ClariFit plugins](http://plugins.clarifit.com/) you may want to update the `$console_wrapper.js` file that's  included with each plugin. I'll be sure to include the update file for  each of the plugin's updates.
