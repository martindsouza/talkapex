Logger is a PL/SQL logging and debugging framework. It's used in many organizations to instrument code in their Oracle applications. [Tyler Muth](http://tylermuth.wordpress.com/) created Logger a few years ago and has since released several upgrades, the last being 1.4.0.

I contacted Tyler a few months ago about the possibility of working together to upgrade Logger and expand on its capabilities. Since then we've been busy working on Logger on our spare time (which isn't much these days). That being said, I'm pleased to announce that [Logger 2.0.0.a01](https://github.com/tmuth/Logger---A-PL-SQL-Logging-Utility/tree/master/releases/) (Alpha) is now available to download!

Besides some underlying changes, such as moving to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and a new build script, the following things were added to Logger:

*  Upgrade process: Can upgrade Logger rather than having to uninstall the old version and install the new version.
*  Log parameters: Standardize the logging of parameters when entering a procedure or function. You won't need to convert the data format as the procedure is overloaded to handle many different object types.
*  Logger level by Client Identifier: This is by far one of the features I think most people wanted in Logger. You can now set the logging level based on a Client Identifier.
*  Other: They're a few other features we may get into this 2.0.0 release. If not they will be added in future releases.You can read more about the new features, along with demo snippets on Logger's new home page: [https://github.com/tmuth/Logger---A-PL-SQL-Logging-Utility](https://github.com/tmuth/Logger---A-PL-SQL-Logging-Utility) The new home page contains all the help text and sample code.

What next? Well we've been busy at work developing Logger now we're looking to the community to help test it out. Please download it, install or upgrade, and give it a try. **If you find any issues please post them on this [simple issue logging form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1HRCYjTi3wkpjt1_mJepA9MgYxGHBtiSg3Dv1G14he_c/viewform).**

Don't forget that this is an alpha release and things may be changed before the final release 2.0.0 release. One thing I'm still up in the air is how we implement `log_params`, as such I highly suspect some of the syntax will change in the upcoming weeks.

When will this be officially released? Calendar year 2013 (sound familiar ;-). In all honesty I hope that we can release this by the end of May. Of course the release date all depends on the feedback we get back from you, so please help test!

If you want to follow updates on this project, I'll be labeling all Logger related posts with "[logger](http://www.talkapex.com/search/label/logger)".
