_In preparation for the release of Logger 2.1.0 I've decided to write a few posts highlighting some of the new features._

The new Logger [documentation](https://github.com/tmuth/Logger---A-PL-SQL-Logging-Utility/wiki) contains a lot of sample code. Though this is good for documentation  purposes I found that I still needed to build a set of demos for various  presentations and demonstrations about Logger. Instead of recreating  demos each time I've started to keep them in a demo folder (included in  each release). This can also be useful for individuals looking to demo  Logger at an organization for the first time.

Though  not complete, expect the list of demos to expand over time. If you have  a demo script you want added, please feel free to send it to me or make  a pull request.
