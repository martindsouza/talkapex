I'll be participating in two sessions at OOW. On Sunday I'll be sitting on the [Printing Options for APEX Q&amp;A Panel](https://oracleus.activeevents.com/2013/connect/search.ww?searchPhrase=UGF10241)&nbsp;which is from 3:30-4:30 in&nbsp;Moscone West - 2005 (code UGF10241).

On Thursday I'll be giving a presentation called&nbsp;[How to Instrument PL/SQL and Oracle Application Express Code](https://oracleus.activeevents.com/2013/connect/search.ww?searchPhrase=CON5469)&nbsp;(code: CON5469) which focuses on leveraging [Logger](https://github.com/tmuth/Logger---A-PL-SQL-Logging-Utility) in your PL/SQL and APEX applications. The presentation is from 12:30-1:30 at Marriott Marquis - Salon 7 on Thursday. I gave this talk in Montreal and I had several people tell me how it can help them in their current development projects. I hope that it will do the same for you.

I'll also be going to the [APEX meetup](http://www.talkapex.com/2013/08/apex-oow-2013-meetup.html) on Tuesday night which is open to everyone. It will be a nice time to have a casual drink and meet people from the APEX development team along with some of the gurus in the industry.

See you next week!
