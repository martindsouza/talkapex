I'm planning to re-brand [Logger](https://github.com/tmuth/Logger---A-PL-SQL-Logging-Utility) to help make it easier for people to find and more marketable in general. I'd appreciate a few minutes of your time to complete a survey that I just built which will help the future growth of Logger.

Please note that this re-branding initiative will not affect it's current open source license or its internal code naming structure (i.e. `logger`).

To do the survey please click [here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/8HTBQ99).

Thank you,
