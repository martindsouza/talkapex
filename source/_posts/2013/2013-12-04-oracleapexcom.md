If you follow me on twitter ([@martindsouza](https://twitter.com/martindsouza)) or the [#orclapex](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23orclapex&amp;src=typd) hashtag you'll have noticed that I've been posting some new links to quickly get to APEX resources.

Last week I got a notice (don't know how I was on that list) that the domain&nbsp;[oracleapex.com](http://oracleapex.com/) was free to purchase. Being the enthusiast that I am I couldn't resist buying it. I also bought it so that it wouldn't be hijacked or domain parked for malicious purposes.

To make things easier for the whole community I'm using the domain as a redirect for APEX which will hopefully help new and existing users to quickly access the reference material they need for APEX development.

**<span style="color: red;">Update (16-Mar-2014): The official/updated list can now be found on [oracleapex.com](http://oracleapex.com/). See&nbsp;[http://www.talkapex.com/2014/03/oracleapexcom-part-2.html](http://www.talkapex.com/2014/03/oracleapexcom-part-2.html) for information about this change.</span>**
