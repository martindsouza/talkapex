If you follow me on twitter ([@martindsouza](https://twitter.com/martindsouza)) or the [#orclapex](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23orclapex&amp;src=typd) hashtag you'll have noticed that I've been posting some new links to quickly get to APEX resources.

Last week I got a notice (don't know how I was on that list) that the domain [oracleapex.com](http://oracleapex.com/) was free to purchase. Being the enthusiast that I am I couldn't resist buying it. I also bought it so that it wouldn't be hijacked or domain parked for malicious purposes.

To make things easier for the whole community I'm using the domain as a redirect for APEX which will hopefully help new and existing users to quickly access the reference material they need for APEX development.

**<span style="color: red;">Update (16-Mar-2014): The official/updated list can now be found on [oracleapex.com](http://oracleapex.com/). See [http://www.talkapex.com/2014/03/oracleapexcom-part-2.html](http://www.talkapex.com/2014/03/oracleapexcom-part-2.html) for information about this change.</span>**

Here are all the URLs and where they point to:

* [oracleapex.com](http://oracleapex.com/) -> Oracle APEX OTN site
* [addon.oracleapex.com](http://addon.oracleapex.com/) -> APEX Lib Developer Addon
* [api.oracleapex.com](http://api.oracleapex.com/) -> API docs

* [urlsyntax.oracleapex.com](http://urlsyntax.oracleapex.com/) -> Quick link to the URL syntax document page

Thanks to everyone for all the suggestions so far and if you have any other links you'd like to see leave a comment or send me a [tweet](https://twitter.com/martindsouza)!
