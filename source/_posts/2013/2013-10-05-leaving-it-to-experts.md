At [ODTUG](http://odtug.com/) [Kscope 13](http://kscope14.com/) this year in New Orleans, I gave a talk on responsive web design in APEX. During the presentation someone asked me about specific CSS width configurations for different screen sizes. My answer at the time (and I still stand by it) was to use what the APEX team provided as they have experts who's sole job is to focus on these details.

Case in point, today one of the developers on the Oracle APEX team ([Shakeeb Rahman](https://twitter.com/shakeeb)) tweeted the following question "_Anyone know of a study that talks about web contrast and if dark gray is better than black for web text?_". I don't know the answer nor have I ever even thought if it before.

Similar to most developers, my job requires me to to keep up to date on technology and design patterns but it's humanly impossible to be an expert in every single area. Having amazing and committed developers on the Oracle APEX team allows me to not worry about all the finer details and focus on providing my clients with solid solutions for their business problems using APEX.

To summarize, not only is APEX a great development framework for the Oracle technology stack, they also have experts covering all the small details that most developers have never thought of or don't have the time to research.

Here's the full [Twitter conversation](https://twitter.com/shakeeb/status/386234133724155904):
