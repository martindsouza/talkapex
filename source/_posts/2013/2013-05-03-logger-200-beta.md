_Logger is a PL/SQL logging and debugging framework. It's used in many organizations to instrument code in their Oracle applications. [Tyler Muth](http://tylermuth.wordpress.com/) created Logger a few years ago and has since released several upgrades, the last being 1.4.0._

After some great feedback, I'm pleased to announce that we've just launched [Logger 2.0.0 Beta](https://github.com/tmuth/Logger---A-PL-SQL-Logging-Utility/tree/master/releases/2.0.0.b01). Please download it, install, and provide us with your feedback or any issues you encounter. If you installed the alpha version you'll need to do a complete [uninstall](https://github.com/tmuth/Logger---A-PL-SQL-Logging-Utility#uninstall) and [reinstall](https://github.com/tmuth/Logger---A-PL-SQL-Logging-Utility#install-into-an-existing-schema) before using the beta version. The beta version will upgrade over 1.4.0.

The beta release includes some minor bug fixes and documentation updates. The major change is that the `log_params` procedure has been dropped (I had hinted that this may happen in my [previous post](http://www.talkapex.com/2013/04/logger-200-alpha.html)). Instead, to remain consistent, a fourth parameter has been added to the major log procedures to support a parameters array. For more information, see the documentation regarding [`p_params`](https://github.com/tmuth/Logger---A-PL-SQL-Logging-Utility#p_params-optional).

If you have any feedback, suggestions, or issues please use the project's [issues](https://github.com/tmuth/Logger---A-PL-SQL-Logging-Utility/issues) page. If you don't already have a GitHub account, you'll need to create one (it's free). If your curious as to the direction of this project, please look at the [issues](https://github.com/tmuth/Logger---A-PL-SQL-Logging-Utility/issues) page and you'll see what we have planned and what others have requested.

This release will be the last major release before officially launching Logger 2.0.0. Once it's released I'd like to start working on some of the feature requests that have been suggested.

Special thanks to Mark Wagoner for helping test and provide some additional feedback on the latest release.
