Last year at Kscope 12 in San Antonio I gave a different kind of talk than I normally do. It was called "[Building a Better Team](http://www.talkapex.com/p/presentations.html)" and focused on the importance and value of doing peer reviews and having coding standards.

It just so happened that Jeff Erickson, from Oracle Magazine, was in attendance. Following my talk Jeff asked me to do an interview for the Community: Up Close section of the magazine. The article, [_On Code Reviews and Standards_](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/issue-archive/2013/13-jan/o13upclose-1886634.html) was published this month! I've also included the video interview below.

If you don't already have a peer review process implemented in your organization I hope this article will help motivate you to start one.
