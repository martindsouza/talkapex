Frank Hoogendoorn and I will be giving a presentation on APEX at the Calgary Oracle User Group (COUG) on this Thursday, May 28th, at 8:00 am. For those of you that are thinking about implementing APEX within your organization this will be an excellent presentation as we will go over both the business and technical reasons why we are using APEX. We'll also be demonstrating some of our newest APEX applications
