Taking a note out of Simon Sinek's famous [TED talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action.html), I won't focus on the _How_ or _What_ for [Kscope 13](http://kscope13.com/), rather the _Why_.

So why does Kscope exist? It's goal is to bring together Oracle developers from around the world and offer them a unique learning and networking experience unlike any other conference. 

I've been to many other conferences, Oracle related or otherwise, and none offer the experience that you will get at Kscope. That being said, they're still 12 days to take advantage of the [Early Bird rate ](http://kscope13.com/registration)and if you haven't already signed up I encourage you to do so!
