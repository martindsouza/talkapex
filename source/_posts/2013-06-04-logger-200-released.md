After several months in Beta, I'm please to announce that Logger  2.0.0 is now officially released! You can download the zip file from the  [2.0.0 release page](https://github.com/tmuth/Logger---A-PL-SQL-Logging-Utility/tree/master/releases/2.0.0). 

Over  the past few months I've blogged about some of the significant changes  we've made to Logger. Here are all the articles describing some of the  new functionality:

*   [Alpha](http://www.talkapex.com/2013/04/logger-200-alpha.html) (contains some high level change notes)
*   [Beta](http://www.talkapex.com/2013/05/logger-200-beta.html) (contains some installation upgrade notes)
*   [Enable Session Specific Logging](http://www.talkapex.com/2013/05/logger-200-enable-session-specific.html)
*   [Session Specific Logging - Advanced Features](http://www.talkapex.com/2013/05/logger-200-session-specific-logging.html)
*   [Logging Parameters](http://www.talkapex.com/2013/05/logger-200-logging-parameters.html)The  upgraded help document on the main Github page contains all the  detailed information about Logger as well as examples. In the future,  I'll be looking at moving it towards the Wiki page for better  organization but for now it should do.

If you've never used it before check it out, best of all it's free and open source!
