A while ago [Tobias Arnhold](http://www.apex-at-work.com/) posted a tweet suggesting that we should have an APEX Plugins competition. After a few months, many emails, a lot of effort by an excellent group of people, and the support from [ODTUG](http://www.odtug.com/), I'm pleased to announce the first ever world wide [APEX Plug-ins competition](http://www.odtug.com/apex/f?p=500:450:0)! Here's a short blurb from the official announcement on odtug.com:

_ODTUG is holding its first ever world wide [APEX Plug-ins competition](http://www.odtug.com/apex/f?p=500:450:0)! This is your opportunity to write an APEX plug-in and have it viewed by the entire international APEX community and maybe crowned 2012 ODTUG APEX Plug-in Developer of the Year! Even better, there are some really great prizes with the grand prize being a** free pass to Kscope13** or a **Jawbone Jambox**!_

This is your opportunity to showcase your Oracle APEX Plugin skills and win some really cool [prizes](http://www.odtug.com/apex/f?p=500:450:0#prizes). We also made a special Experts category to ensure everyone is on a level playing field.

I hope this encourages everyone to try to submit a plugin and help expand the list of already fantastic plugins.

Good luck!
