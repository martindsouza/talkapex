_This is a duplicate post originating from OraOpenSource. Normally I try not to duplicate content but in this case I really wanted to get the message out._

_Just like any other programming language they're some common tools/features that are not offered natively within the Oracle PL/SQL APIs. As such, most developers start compiling a list of these common tools and create their own utility packages or code snippets.

We're looking to create a master utility package(s), currently called OOS Utils. Before we can do that **we need your help**! If you have a common snippet of code, procedure, or function that you think will be useful to the entire community, please go to: [https://github.com/OraOpenSource/oos-utils/issues](https://github.com/OraOpenSource/oos-utils/issues) and submit a new issue with your suggestion. If you just have an idea but don't have the source code, please submit it anyways and we'll try to add it in.

_Hint: If you want to format your code nicely when submitting a recommendation use the following template.&nbsp;_

<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">```sql</span>
<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">your_code_here</span>
<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">```</span>

_Note that those are not apostrophes, rather they are [backticks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#code-formatting) (key in the top left of your keyboard)._

Once we have enough entries, we'll look at grouping all the suggestions into logical packages and start the development process.

We look forward to your recommendations and can't wait to launch this when it's ready! As always if you want to stay up to date with everything that's going on, please subscribe to our [email list](http://www.oraopensource.com/email-list).
