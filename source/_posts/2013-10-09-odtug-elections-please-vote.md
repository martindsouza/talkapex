It's that time of year again that half of the positions for the ODTUG Board of Directors must be voted on by its paid members. I am up for re-election this year and would appreciate your continued support in helping the ODTUG community.

To view the everyone who is running for the board and the link to vote please go to: [http://www.odtug.com/2014_election](http://www.odtug.com/2014_election). Please remember that only paid ODTUG members are allowed to vote and that you are allowed to vote for up to five people.

I have included my campaign statement and profile below. Thank you for your support.

**Campaign Statement**

Over the past two years, I have had the privilege to represent the Oracle APEX community as a director for ODTUG. I have made the decision to run again this year for the ODTUG board and am looking for your support in doing so.

During my two-year tenure, I have been involved in several committees within ODTUG that have helped bring conferences around the world, improved marketing initiatives, and organized developer contests. 

I have been able to build strong relationships with other ODTUG board members, Oracle employees, and many developers in the APEX community. These relationships have allowed me to be a liaison between all three groups and help to relay ideas and opportunities to the appropriate parties. I hope to continue to be able to facilitate open communication over the next two years.

I am looking for your vote to continue as an ODTUG board member to represent developers within one of the world’s largest Oracle user groups. Thank you in advance for your support.
