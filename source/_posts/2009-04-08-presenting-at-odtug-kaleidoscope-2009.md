Frank Hoogendoorn and I will be presenting at the Application Express Symposium on Sunday at ODTUG Kaleidoscope 2009\. Our presentation is called "<span style="font-weight:bold;">Getting the Ape out of APEX</span>".

I attended ODTUG last year in New Orleans and was amazed with all the excellent APEX presentations, I'm sure this year will be even better. If you can only attend once conference this year and you are using, or interested in, APEX this is the conference to go to!

You can go to [www.odtugkaleidoscope.com](http://www.odtugkaleidoscope.com/?utm_source=speake) for more information and registration.

See you then.
