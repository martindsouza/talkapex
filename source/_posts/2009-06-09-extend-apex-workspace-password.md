Every so often when you log into the APEX development interface, it will require you to change your account password. This isn't a bad idea, however if you develop in several workspaces, and have multiple accounts, it may be a bit cumbersome. You can extend the account password lifetime by doing the following:

- Login to the APEX Admin
- Home / Manage Service / Security
- Change the Account Password Lifetime (days) to whatever you need.
