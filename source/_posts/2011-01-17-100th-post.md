Two and a half years after starting this blog I'm excited to be writing my 100<sup>th</sup> post! Through this blog I've had the opportunity to meet a lot of people, learn a lot of new things, and given opportunities I may not have otherwise had.

I thought it would be interesting to post some stats about this blog for those that were curious. I wrote my [first post](http://www.talkapex.com/2008/07/manually-creating-tabular-form.html) on July 31st, 2008 but only started to capture analytics starting in March 2009.
<span style="font-style:italic">
<span style="font-weight:bold;">- March 2009</span>
  - ~1500 visits / month
  - ~2400 page views / month

<span style="font-weight:bold;">- Current monthly avg (Dec 2010)</span>
  - ~3500 visits / month
  - ~5300 page views / month

<span style="font-weight:bold;">- Overall (since March 2009)</span>
  - ~53,000 visits
  - ~85,000 page views
  - ~150 countries
</span>
Thanks for following along and providing feedback.
