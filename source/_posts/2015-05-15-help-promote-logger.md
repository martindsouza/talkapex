Here's a snippet from a Twitter conversation today between [Steven Feuerstein](https://twitter.com/sfonplsql)&nbsp;and I around a user that created their own PL/SQL logging platform:

<script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script> Steven is absolutely correct when he says "_You haven't done a good enough job promoting it_" ("it" being [Logger](http://www.oraopensource.com/logger/)). Despite my best efforts, promoting Logger is something I've struggled with and need some help.

Based on past emails and conversations, I know they're a lot of developers and organizations using Logger. **If you're using Logger, either personally or within your organization, I need your help. Please blog about it (and post the link in the comments section below), email me a quote that I can use (martin@clarifit.com), Tweet about it (use [#orcllogger](https://twitter.com/hashtag/orcllogger?src=hash)), or mention it at the next conference you go to**.

To those that help promote it, thank you in advance.
