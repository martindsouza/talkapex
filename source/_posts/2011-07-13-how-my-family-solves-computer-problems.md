In my talk, [How to be Create II](http://www.talkapex.com/2011/07/how-to-be-creative-ii-presentation.html), at ODTUG Kscope 11 I discussed what sometimes happens when users try to fix problems themselves. This is a video clip from my presentation on how my family tries to resolve computer problems.

Thanks to [Chris Hritzuk](https://twitter.com/#!/Chris_Hritzuk) for recording this.
