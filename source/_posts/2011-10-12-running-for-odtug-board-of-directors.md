For nearly four years I’ve enjoyed giving back to the Oracle APEX community in various ways such as the Oracle Forums, this blog, talks at various conferences, authoring free plug-ins, and webinars to name a few. Now I want to continue to help out in a different fashion by running for the ODTUG Board of Directors. I believe I will be able to help promote and grow the APEX community through the Board, and I would relish the chance represent all APEX developers.

I’m officially running for the ODTUG Board of Directors and would like your support. If you're a full (paid) ODTUG member please vote for the Board of Directors here: [http://goo.gl/8xqxs](http://goo.gl/8xqxs)&nbsp; Below is a copy of my official nomination:

_**Campaign Statement**&nbsp;_
_I have attended ODTUG Kaleidoscope for several consecutive years and  have been a presenter for the last three. The conference has allowed me  to develop strong relationships with many others in the community, and  the importance of these relationships has proven invaluable. I  continually strive to give back to the community, using my personal time  to answer questions through email, blogs, the Oracle forums, and by  writing technical books. I would like to continue this spirit of giving  back by joining the ODTUG Board of Directors.  As a new board member I will bring a fresh perspective and  out-of-the-box ideas to help promote ODTUG and deliver our message to  the world. I am fortunate enough to have a successful blog with several  thousand unique monthly visitors. It is through this platform, along  with other opportunities such as my consulting firm blog, social  networking, and the multiple annual conferences that I attend from which  I intend to help share the ODTUG mission and values.  The Board plays a pivotal leadership role as both a driving force and a  face of the ODTUG community. I feel that my professional experience as a  leader and mentor will help the Board guide and develop ODTUG for the  future. The Board has responsibility to its most important group - the  members. I will help ensure that the Board serves as both a voice and an  ear for the entire ODTUG community; developers, DBAs, and technical  experts of all things Oracle.  Many thanks for your consideration.&nbsp;_
