_This article is for people looking for help with the ClariFit From/To Date Picker_.

I'm currently in the process of updating some of the plugins I created for ClariFit to support APEX 5.0\. As part of these changes some additional things are happening, mainly listing the plugins in the new [apex.world](http://apex.world/) site and moving the plugins ownership over to [OraOpenSource](https://github.com/OraOpenSource).

The first plugin that has been moved/updated is the ClariFit From/To Date Picker. The plugin is now called OraOpenSource From/To Date Picker and is hosted [here](https://github.com/OraOpenSource/apex-plugin-from-to-datepicker). To help with backwards compatibility the plugin's internal name has remained the same. This means that upgrades will be seamless.

Please post all bugs and enhancement requests on the project's&nbsp;[issue page](https://github.com/OraOpenSource/apex-plugin-from-to-datepicker/issues).

The next plugin that will be updated is the ClariFit Dialog (to be called OraOpenSource Dialog). It is currently being tested and will be officially released pending any major bugs. If you'd like any other ClariFit plugins updated to APEX 5.0 please leave a comment and I'll look into it.
