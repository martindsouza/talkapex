In case you missed it on the [ODTUG](https://twitter.com/BambiPrice) blog, I along with [Bambi Price](https://twitter.com/BambiPrice) are starting a new Marketing Committee and are looking for some volunteers to join the committee. All the information can be found in [this article](http://www.odtug.com/p/bl/et/blogid=7&amp;blogaid=187).

If you're looking to get involved with the ODTUG community and/or passionate about marketing this is an excellent opportunity for you. I look forward to working on this committee and help with ODTUG's marketing efforts.
