I'll be at [HEUG Alliance 2017](http://www.alliance-conference.com) in Las Vegas next week. I'll be giving a presentation on APEX with fellow [Insum](insum.ca) colleagues Christian Larocque and [Sylvain Martel](https://twitter.com/InsumSmartel) called _From student systems to admin systems, one tool : Oracle APEX._ The goal of this presentation is to highlight the advantages of using Oracle APEX for higher education institutions.

This will be my first time attending Alliance and I found it difficult to plan my schedule using the existing site. I wasn't able to easily search all the presentation information at once and on a per time slot basis. APEX to the rescue! We created a simple [APEX scheduling application](https://demo.insum.ca/ords/f?p=124) which allows attendees to easily see all the different session slots and search on all the presentations for each slot. For those that have never seen or used APEX before this application shows how easy and quick it is to get a very useful application up and running in a short period of time.

For those attending Alliance 2017 and want to learn more about APEX we're offering free "Ask the Expert" sessions. To book a time with one of our experts register [here](http://info.insum.ca/meet-integration-expert-alliance17).
