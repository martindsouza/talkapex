For those in Montreal and the surrounding area I encourage you to come out to the [Montreal Oracle Dev Day](http://info.insum.ca/en/oracle-developer-day-mtl) on October 25th. The event is just $15 which is a steal considering that 3 Oracle ACE Directors will be presenting. _Note: The cost was to help reduce no-shows that occur when having entirely free events._

Here's a summary agenda of the presentations with the full agenda [here](http://info.insum.ca/en/oracle-developer-day-montreal-agenda-1):

- Time: 8:30-4:30
- Location: [Centre for Sustainable Development](https://goo.gl/maps/F4cGdR9d8Py)
- Session 1: Oracle speaker (TBA)
- Session 2: [Francis Mignault](https://twitter.com/fr4ncis): Cloudy with a chance of Oracle APEX
- Session 3: [Martin D'Souza](https://twitter.com/martindsouza): Open Source PL/SQL Utility Tools for Oracle
- Session 4: [Dimitri Gielis](https://twitter.com/dgielis): APEX Reporting tips & tricks

Aside from the presentations attendees will have plenty of opportunity to network and share your Oracle development experiences. The speakers will be available all day so feel free to bring your APEX questions!
