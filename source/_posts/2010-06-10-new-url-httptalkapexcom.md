Well it's been a while since I've had any new posts on this blog. I've been extremely busy with "after school" activities <span style="font-style:italic;">(soccer, speed skating, biking, etc...)</span>

I don't have an APEX specific post today but I do have a few items to discuss. The first, in case you haven't noticed yet, is that I've changed the URL of this blog from [http://apex-smb.blogspot.com](http://apex-smb.blogspot.com) to [http://TalkApex.com](http://talkapex.com), The old URL, [http://apex-smb.blogspot.com](http://apex-smb.blogspot.com) will still work so you don't need to update any old links.

Just because I haven't had time to write about APEX, doesn't mean I've forgotten about this blog. I've been compiling a fairly large list of new things to write about over the past few months. I hope to spend a some time soon to write about these items.

Last, but not least, I'll be giving 2 presentations at [ODTUG Kaleidoscope](http://www.odtugkaleidoscope.com/). I submitted my presentation for the CD, however I think that they'll change significantly by the time I present. As such I will post the final slides used for my presentation here after the conference. The presentations I'll be giving are

*   <span style="font-weight:bold;">Enhancing APEX Security</span>: Monday 2:30~3:30
*   <span style="font-weight:bold;">How to be Creative: Using the APEX Dictionary to Create Solutions</span>: Tuesday 4:45~5:45Hope to see most of you at ODTUG!
