Each year the Oracle APEX community gets together at Oracle Open World (OOW) to have a few beers and catch up. This is a great informal event and its your chance to network with a lot of people in the APEX community and meet some of the gurus and members of the core APEX development team.

Normally [Dimitri Gielis](http://dgielis.blogspot.ca/) organizes the meetup, however he is expecting his third child and understandably he will not be coming to OOW. As such I've been handed the torch to help organize the event this year. To be honest by "I" I really mean [Lauren Prezby](https://twitter.com/lprezby) at [ODTUG](http://odtug.com/) has done the planning and found our venue for this year :-)

We'll be having the annual APEX OOW Meetup at [Johnny Foleys](http://www.johnnyfoleys.com/) on Tuesday at 7:30 onwards.
