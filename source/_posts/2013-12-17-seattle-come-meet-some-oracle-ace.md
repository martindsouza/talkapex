As part of the Kickoff to [Kscope](http://kscope14.com/) campaign ODTUG is hosting a panel discussion in Seattle with Oracle ACE Directors including [myself](http://twitter.com/martindsouza),&nbsp;[Kellyn Pot'Vin](https://twitter.com/DBAKevlar), [Tim Gorman](https://twitter.com/timothyjgorman), [Tim Tow](https://twitter.com/timtow), and [Cameron Lackpour](https://twitter.com/CameronLackpour). The panel will be moderated by none other than ODTUG president [Monty&nbsp;Latiolais](https://twitter.com/monty_odtug).

The event will be held at the&nbsp;Sheraton Seattle Hotel - Jefferson Room from 4 to 6pm and will be followed by a networking Happy Hour where you can meet other Oracle professionals in Seattle and the panelists. Best part is that it's all free!
