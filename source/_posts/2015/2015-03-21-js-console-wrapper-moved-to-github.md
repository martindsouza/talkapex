I recently received an email from Google Code stating that they will be shutting down their site early next year. Seeing as an JS Console Wrapper was hosted on there I have had to move it to GitHub: [https://github.com/martindsouza/js-console-wrapper](https://github.com/martindsouza/js-console-wrapper)

They're some nice features in Console wrapper that integrate well with APEX however it was primarily created to get around the lack of support for Console in IE. Since the newer versions of IE now support Console, Console Wrapper may no longer be necessary.

If you do use Console Wrapper and would like to see it be improve please create an [issue](https://github.com/martindsouza/js-console-wrapper/issues) on the project page.
