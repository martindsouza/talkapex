For those in Montreal, I'll be presenting at the local #orclapex meetup this Thursday, August 13, evening from 5-7\. All the information can be found on the [meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/fr/orclapex-MTL/events/224538959/).

**Top 10 APEX API**

_APEX has a lot of excellent APIs. These APIs, for both PL/SQL and JavaScript, can help extend your application and improve your development. This presentation will cover some of the most useful APIs (both documented and undocumented) that are available._

The presentation will be in English however I can take questions in both French and English.

I look forward to meeting the Montreal APEX community!
