I'm pleased to announce that [Logger](http://www.oraopensource.com/logger/) has found a new home and will be maintained by [OraOpenSource](http://www.oraopensource.com/). A very big thank you goes out to [Tyler Muth](https://twitter.com/tmuth) for starting this project many years ago and handing over the reins to OraOpenSource.

Here's a brief FAQ regarding the move:

### What is Logger?

[Logger](http://www.oraopensource.com/logger/) is a (free) open source logging tool for Oracle PL/SQL. It is used in many instances ranging from small applications to very large applications in major corporations.

### What will happen with links to the old project page?

They'll still work. The project was forked and a notice was put up on the old Github site letting people know its new home.

### Will Logger still remain open source / free?

Yes. We'll update the license slightly so that it will be easier to understand and use within your code. This will not affect any existing implementations.

### When is the next release?

I did a lot of work last year, then was sidelined with my concussion. It turns out that picking up a project after not touching it for 8 months takes some time.

Since I'm working on this project as part of my rehab I can not give a definite time frame. As soon as the beta version is ready I'll make it available.

### What is in the next release?

Lots of great stuff! Going forward you can monitor what will be in each subsequent release by tracking the upcoming [milestones](https://github.com/OraOpenSource/Logger/milestones) on the project's [issue](https://github.com/OraOpenSource/Logger/issues) page.

### Will you still post info on Logger on this site?

Over the years I have written a lot about Logger and posted it on this blog. To maintain a consistent branding and marketing effort all future posts regarding Logger will be on [OraOpenSource's blog](http://www.oraopensource.com/blog/).

### What can I do to help?

Right now the best thing you can do is sign up for the email list (link on [oraopensource.com/logger](http://www.oraopensource.com/logger/)). We'll be announcing the beta version and next major release when it's available. You can also follow OraOpenSource on twitter: [@oraopensource](https://twitter.com/oraopensource).

Once the next release is available we'll be looking for help from the community to continue to develop and maintain Logger.
