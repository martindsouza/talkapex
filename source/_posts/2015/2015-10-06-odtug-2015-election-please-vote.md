The ODTUG Board of Directors election is [now officially open](http://www.odtug.com/page/2016-nominees). Paid ODTUG members can cast their ballot between Oct 6th - Oct 27th. If you are a paid member you will get an email with the link, username, and voter id.

I am running for the ODTUG Board of Directors and I am looking for your support to continue to help the ODTUG community for another two years.

Here is my official campaign statement:

_Over the past four years, I have had the privilege to represent the Oracle APEX Community as a Director for ODTUG. I have made the decision to run again this year for the ODTUG Board and am looking for your support in doing so._
_
__During my four-year tenure, I have been involved in several committees within ODTUG that have helped bring conferences around the world, improved marketing initiatives, and organized developer contests.&nbsp;_
_
__I have been able to build strong relationships with other ODTUG Board Members, Oracle employees, and many developers in the APEX community. These relationships have allowed me to be a liaison between all three groups and help relay ideas and opportunities to the appropriate parties. I hope to continue to be able to facilitate open communication over the next two years._
_
__I am looking for your vote to continue as an ODTUG Board Member to represent developers within one of the worldâ€™s largest Oracle user groups. Thank you in advance for your support._

Thank you in advance,

Martin
