If you can't get enough APEX there's now an [APEX Podcast](http://apex.press/talkshow)! This is a great opportunity to know more about the people behind APEX and some key people in the APEX community.

[Juergen Schuster](https://twitter.com/juergenschuster) and I co-host the show (I only joined on recently) and it has been a lot of fun so far.

You can download each episode on the official site ([apex.press/talkshow](http://apex.press/talkshow)) or subscribe on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-oracle-apex-talkshow/id979577290?mt=2).

_Note: In the latest podcast we mentioned that we're looking for sponsors for the show. If you or your organization is interested in the opportunity please [email me](mailto:martin@talkapex.com)._
