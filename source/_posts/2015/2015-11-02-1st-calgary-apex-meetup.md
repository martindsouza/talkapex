<div>We're having our [1st inaugural APEX meetup](http://www.meetup.com/orclapex-YYC/events/226256566/) on Thursday Nov 12th! I'll be giving a presentation about APEX 5 and the new [apex.world](http://apex.world/) site.</div><div>
</div><div>FAQs I've received about this meetup:</div><div>

*   Does it cost anything? _No, it's entirely free&nbsp;_
*   What should I bring? _Yourself. Some people like to bring their laptop to try things out at the same time.&nbsp;_
*   Is this a sales pitch: _No, it's by the APEX community, for the APEX community.&nbsp;_
*   Will only APEX items be covered? _Primarily we'll be talking about APEX but may deviate a bit in the future to cover some SQL, PL/SQL, and web technologies. These topics are all relevant for APEX developers.&nbsp;_
*   Where can I get one of the cool APEX stickers I see everyone has on Twitter? _At the meetup. I've got a whole stack to give away._</div><div>
