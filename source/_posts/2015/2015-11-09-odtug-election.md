If you were at Oracle Open World a few weeks ago you may have missed that the [ODTUG Board of Directors election results](http://archive.skem1.com/Campaigner/Public/t.show?9331d--5txha-19v43px8&amp;_v=2) were posted.

The newly elected directors are:

* [Danny Bryant](https://twitter.com/dbaontap)
* [Gary Crisci](https://twitter.com/garycrisci)
* [Natalie Delemar](https://twitter.com/essbaselady)
* [Martin D'Souza](https://twitter.com/martindsouza)

I first must thank all the people that voted for me again this year. It means a lot that I have the support of the APEX and Oracle communities

They're a few board members who will not be returning next year. They all have done a lot for ODTUG and its members.

  * Monty has been the President of ODTUG for the past few years. He's done an amazing job leading the organization. Monty's lasting legacy at ODTUG will be the [Leadership Program](http://www.odtug.com/p/cm/ld/fid=127). He took a risk trying it out and it has been a very big success helping develop leaders within the ODTUG community.
* [David Schleis](https://twitter.com/dschleis)
  * David has helped re-energize the traditional developer and DBA communities. Over the past two years he helped merged them into one united "database" community. I look forward to David to continue help out with the database community in the coming years.

I also need to say a special thank you to the current board for supporting me over the past year. Last year was a very difficult time for me personally and they all stepped up and supported me along the way. This is something I will never forget and will always be thankful for.

As ODTUG has a six year term limit for directors, this will be my last two years. I look forward to making them as good as the first four. If you have any feedback or things you'd like to see happen within the community please let me know.
