I'm pleased to announce that [Beginning Oracle Application Express 4](http://goo.gl/NxHoF) is finally published! I co-authored this book along with [Doug Gault](http://douggault.blogspot.com/), Karen Cannell, Patrick Cimolini, and Timothy St. Hilaire. Co-authoring this book was a very interesting experience which was well worth the time and effort.

This book is aimed at beginner to intermediate APEX developers. It contains a lot of step by step instructions and detailed explanations to help you get a solid foundation for APEX development. You can purchase it from [Amazon.com](http://goo.gl/NxHoF). If you'd prefer a soft copy the publisher, [Apress](http://apress.com/book/view/1430231475), also offers the [eBook](http://apress.com/book/view/1430231475).
