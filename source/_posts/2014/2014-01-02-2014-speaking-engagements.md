Wow, 2013 went by in a blur. Lots of exciting things happened last year both personally and professionally and I really look forward to 2014! Speaking of which, I have finally confirmed talks for the first half of the year which I've included below:

**[Kickoff to Kscope](http://kscope14.com/events) - Oracle ACE Directors Panel**
_Seattle, Washington_
_Jan 9th 4-6pm - [Sheraton Seattle Hotel](https://goo.gl/maps/GPoaG) - Jefferson Room_

Bring your Oracle questions (in pretty much any category) and discuss them with myself and fellow panelists (and ACE Directors) Kellyn Pot'Vin, Tim Gorman, Tim Tow, and Cameron Lackpour. This session will be moderated by ODTUG president Monty Latiolais.

Following the panel there will be a Happy Hour networking event. Both the panel and happy our are free!

**[Oregon and Southern Washington Oracle User Group](http://www.oswoug.org/OSWOUG/Home.html) (OSWOUG)**
Title: APEX and HTML 5
_Seattle, Washington_
_Feb 19th 4:30pm - Oracle Office ([411 108th Ave NE #900, Bellevue, WA, 98004](https://goo.gl/maps/lQFT4))_

As the title suggests, I'll be talking about some really cool HTML 5 features and how to integrate them in your APEX applications. Of course I'll stick around after to answer any of questions.

Note: The OSWOUG website will be updated soon with my complete abstract.

**[OGh APEX World](https://www.ogh.nl/page.aspx?event=213)**
Title: TBC (waiting for final abstracts to be accepted)
_Zeist, Netherlands_
_March 25th (exact location TBC)_

This will be my first talk in Europe! The speaker list is already very impressive with several ACE Directors and people from the APEX development team.

I'm not able to comment on the talk that I'll be giving yet as I sent in several abstracts to the content committee and will find out which one is selected soon. Once it's finalized I'll update this post with the exact details.

The above link is to the Call for Papers site which is still open until January 10th. If you're in Europe and interested in presenting at APEX World, it's still not too late.

I also hope to go speed skating there as the Netherlands is a mecca for long track speed skating. Trying to talk [Roel Hartman](http://roelh/) into a race jj ;-)

**[Calgary Oracle User Group](http://coug.ab.ca/events/calendar-of-events/?month=apr&amp;yr=2014) (COUG)**
Title: Instrumenting your PL/SQL and APEX Applications
_Calgary, Alberta_
_April 17 8:30am - Suncor Energy Centre (West Tower). [150 6th Avenue SW](https://goo.gl/maps/nwXaQ). 17th floor â€“ Room 17L_

This talk will cover [Logger](https://github.com/tmuth/Logger---A-PL-SQL-Logging-Utility), an open source logging tool that I've been actively working on, and how to integrate it with APEX. I'll be covering a lot of PL/SQL integration so if you're not an active APEX developer it'll still be relevant.

[**ODTUG Kscope 14**](http://kscope14.com/)
Title: Just Log It.
Title: APEX 5 (TBC)
_Seattle, Washington_
_June 22-26 -_ _[Sheraton Seattle Hotel](https://goo.gl/maps/GPoaG)_

_It goes without saying the Kscope 14 is the premier Oracle and APEX conference to attend. Besides having excellent content there's a lot of great opportunities to network and meet the experts from around the world. If you've read an Oracle book before, odds are the author(s) will be at Kscope. Best part is everyone is very friendly and approachable._

I'll be giving two presentations. The first is on [Logger](https://github.com/tmuth/Logger---A-PL-SQL-Logging-Utility), an open source logging tool that I've been actively working on, and how to integrate it with APEX. The other presentation will be on APEX 5\. Seeing as it's not out yet I don't have a specific topic but I'll make sure it's interesting.

That covers the first half of 2014\. I'm really looking forward to all the events and most importantly seeing and meeting everyone!
