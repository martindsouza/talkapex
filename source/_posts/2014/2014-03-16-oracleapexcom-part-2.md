Back in December [I blogged about](http://www.talkapex.com/2013/12/oracleapexcom.html) the new domain: [oracleapex.com](http://oracleapex.com/). I used the domain to host shortcuts to common links for APEX. One example that I use on a regular basis is [api.oracleapex.com](http://api.oracleapex.com/) which points to the latest API APEX documentation.

Initially I used the blog post to host the list of available shortcuts. This wasn't the best solution but it allowed me to quickly inform everyone of the URLs. I have since created an application (built using APEX of course) to list all the redirect shortcuts on [oracleapex.com](http://oracleapex.com/).

Check it out and let me know what you think. Of course if you'd like a specific URL please let me know either by leaving a comment or tweeting me at [@martindsouza](https://twitter.com/martindsouza)
