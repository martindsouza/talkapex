I'll be heading to Seattle soon for [ODTUG](http://odtug.com/)&nbsp;[Kscope 14](http://kscope14.com/) which officially kicks off on Sunday, June 22nd. Kscope is the premier Oracle developer conference with experts flying in from around the world to participate in a week lot of excellent talks and great networking opportunities.

I will be giving the following presentations on APEX and PL/SQL / at these events this year.

**Lunch with Oracle ACEs**

_When:_&nbsp;Mon Jun 23, 2014, 11:15 - 1:00 pm

_Itâ€™s your chance to meet the ACE Directors and ACEs up close and personal. They will be sitting at tables designated with topics of their expertise. Feel free to join one of those tables for lunch to ask technical questions or just to meet and talk with these Oracle user legends._

Just for the record, I didn't come up with description ;-). Essentially most of the ACEs (ACE Directors, ACEs, and ACE Associates) will be sitting at different tables in the lunch area and you can sit at their table. If you have questions for a specific person bring them and ask them. If you read this blog then you know I'm good for any APEX, PL/SQL, SQL, and Web questions in general. Of course I'm always open to talk about anything else!

**Just Log It.**

****_When_**: Mon Jun 23, 2014, Session 2, 1:15 pm - 2:15 pm
Room: 607

_**Abstract:&nbsp;**Code instrumentation is critical in helping developers debug applications. This presentation will cover Logger, which is an open-source PL/SQL logging tool used in many organizations. The latest features of Logger will be discussed, along with integration into APEX and how to take proactive approaches to error handling in your applications._

This talk will cover the open source PL/SQL logging tool: [Logger](http://oralogger.com/). I'll also be covering some of the new features that are being actively worked on.

**APEX &amp; HTML5**

_Note: this was supposed to be a talk on APEX 5.0 and had to be changed due to some scheduling conflicts. If you were hoping to see the APEX 5.0 talk I encourage you to go to Dietmar Aust's presentation on Tues at 2:00 pm in room 303._

**_When_**: Tues Jun 24, 2014, Session 7, 11:15 am - 12:15 pm
Room: 612

**_Abstract:&nbsp;_**_This presentation will cover some of the new HTML 5 features and how to integrate them in APEX. HTML 5 is the next major version for HTML. It consists of many new features, which will make developer's jobs a lot easier and improve end-user experience. This presentation will highlight some of these new features and demonstrate how to leverage them within an APEX application. New features include (but not limited to) drag &amp; drop, media, storage, and graphics._

I have given several HTML 5 talks at Kscope before and they have all covered new features. This is no different as it will cover some really cool new features in HTML and show how you can add them to your APEX applications.
