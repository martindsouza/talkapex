I have uploaded the slides from the my talk on HTML5 that I gave at ODTUG Kscope 12 last week. The slides include comments and links to various demos. I haven't had the opportunity to clean up the drag &amp; drop file upload demo and I will post that separately when I have some free time.

You can [download](http://goo.gl/TpqRE) the slides or go to the [Presentations](http://www.talkapex.com/p/presentations.html) page to see full abstract and download link. If you have any questions, comments, or feedback please feel free to send me an email (email address in slides).
