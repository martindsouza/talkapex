I'll be presenting at [ODTUG Kaleidoscope](http://www.odtugkaleidoscope.com) in Washington DC this year. If you haven't already signed up I suggest you do so before March 24th as they have an early bird special.

I've been to the past 2 Kaleidoscope conferences where I've learned a great deal about APEX and met some great people. It doesn't matter if you're a seasoned APEX developer or new to APEX, there's always something to learn and a lot of excellent presentations for all levels.

This year I'll be giving 2 presentations on APEX ([http://www.odtugkaleidoscope.com/apex.html#dsouza](http://www.odtugkaleidoscope.com/apex.html#dsouza))

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Enhancing APEX Security</span>: APEX has some excellent built-in configurable security features. This presentation will go over some extra functionality you can add to your APEX applications that will make it more secure both in the front-end and back-end. Primary focus will be on "enhanced session state protection" and "poor man's" VPD for Oracle XE.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">How to be Creative: Using the APEX Dictionary to Create Solutions</span>: The APEX dictionary is a very useful tool which can help enhance existing features in APEX. This presentation will cover how you can use the dictionary to resolve your problems. It will include some real-life issues and how the APEX dictionary was used to resolve them

Of course these presentations may be slightly altered based on the new features and functionality of APEX 4.0\. 

I look forward to seeing everyone in Washington.
