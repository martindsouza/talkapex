If you've ever thought of starting your own blog or wanted to write a detailed article on some cool APEX or Oracle feature but didn't know where to start, now's your big chance! The [ODTUG Technical Journal](http://www.odtug.com/technical-journal-corner) is looking for some new articles and we'd like to see articles from first time contributors.

Signing up is easy. Simply email Karen Cannell (kcannell@odtug.com) and let her know that you're interested in writing an article for the journal. Then you can work out a schedule with her. After that, all you need to do is write the article, Karen will take care of the rest.

This is a great opportunity to get your name out there and also promote what you and your organization have been been working on. I'm looking forward to seeing some great content from the APEX community.
