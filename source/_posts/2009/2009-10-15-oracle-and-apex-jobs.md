A lot of people were affected by the recession and may have lost their jobs. I know they're several companies looking for talented workers. To help out I've decided to start a small Jobs section on my blog (see right hand side). If you're interested in submitting a job, please leave a comment on this post with the following information:

- Job Title
- City the job is in
- Link to position

To keep with the theme of this blog please only submit Oracle (SQL,PL/SQL) and APEX related jobs.

<span style="font-style:italic;">On a side note I may create a small application where people can post jobs specific to APEX.</span>
