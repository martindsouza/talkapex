[stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) is a programming Q & A site that  [Jeff Atwood](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/) and [Joel Spolsky](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/) created a while ago. It is now a very popular programming Q & A site and takes a different approach to asking questions then conventional forums.

They recently launched a site which allows individuals to host their own version of the application that focuses on a specific topic. I decided to register [apex.stackexchange.com](http://apex.stackexchange.com) for Oracle Application Express (APEX) questions.

I realize that the [APEX Forum](http://forums.oracle.com/forums/forum.jspa?forumID=137&start=0) is the main source of questions and answers regarding APEX, but I thought I'd see if anyone was interested in a different approach to handle questions.

If you're interested in trying it out, please go to: [http://apex.stackexchange.com](http://apex.stackexchange.com). You don't need to register to ask a question, but if you want to you can register using an [OpenID](http://openid.net/) account.
