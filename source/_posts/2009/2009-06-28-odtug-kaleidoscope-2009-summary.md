I just got back from [ODTUG Kaleidoscope 2009](http://www.odtugkaleidoscope.com/). I met a lot of great people and saw many excellent presentations. My biggest regret was not being able to see everyone's presentations! Here are some highlights from the conference:

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Sunday APEX Symposium</span>: Saw some excellent presentations on how APEX was used in other organizations.

  - [Joel Kallman](http://joelkallman.blogspot.com/) (Oracle) had a great opening presentation going over the history and future of APEX

  - Olivier Dupont (iAdvise): Excellent use of APEX at the airport, even without a mouse or browser access!

  - [My presentation](http://apex-smb.blogspot.com/2009/06/odtug-kaleidoscope-twitter.html): Mike Kinahan did a great job filling in for Frank Hoogendoorn on short notice, however my camera man wasn't as good (see picture below). <span style="font-style:italic">If anyone has some pictures of the presentation can you please let me know?</span>

  - Dennis Vanill (PAETEC Software): Using page 0 to cut down on common task for many pages.

  - Jan Navratil (CampusIT): Demonstrated that APEX can be used in mission critical applications. Use translation as a configuration technique for each client's definitions.

  - Paul Davidson (Cornerstone Brands): APEX used in large scale call center and how he cut down call time.

  - Shravan Kumar (Apexor): created the term <span style="font-weight:bold;">LAOS</span> (Linux, Apache, Oracle, SQL Developer). Cut down long processes into 4 minutes using APEX!

  - [David Peake](http://dpeake.blogspot.com/) (Oracle): Anounced an [APEX development contest](http://dpeake.blogspot.com/2009/06/application-express-developer.html) for some free tickets to Open World.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Presentations</span>:

  - [Tom Kyte](http://tkyte.blogspot.com/)(Oracle) as always had some great presentation and demo. He stressed (again) use the database for as much as you can since Oracle will do things quicker and faster for you.

  - Michael Hichwa (Oracle): APEX 4.0 Demo. I'll write a separate post about this soon since it will take a lot of space (it's just that good)
<span style="font-style:italic;">Edit: 1-Jul-2009\. [Role Hartman](http://roelhartman.blogspot.com/) wrote an excellent post for APEX 4.0\. Please read it for more info: [http://roelhartman.blogspot.com/2009/07/buzz-around-apex-40.html](http://roelhartman.blogspot.com/2009/07/buzz-around-apex-40.html) </span>

  - [Dietmar Aust](http://daust.blogspot.com/) (Opal Consulting): Free PDF and XLS printing options for APEX. Check his blog for full details

  - [Scott Spendolini](http://spendolini.blogspot.com/) (Sumner Technologies): Managing Multiple APEX applications as one. The full sample application is on his web site here: [http://sumnertechnologies.com/framework](http://sumnertechnologies.com/framework)

  - [Patrick Wolf](http://www.inside-oracle-apex.com/) (Oracle): Had 2 great presentations. I missed his first one, but was able to attend his second presentation. Besides the content he's an excellent speaker so if you ever have a chance to see him present you should go! Patrick was kind enough to show Dennis and I some more APEX 4.0 features and answer a lot of my questions.

  - [Francis Mignault](http://insum-apex.blogspot.com/) (Insum): Multi tenant SaaS APEX applications. I develop SaaS applications as well and it was really nice to see a different development approach.

  - Patrick Cimolini (Cayman Island Government): Development Rules and Guidelines Document for APEX. If you're looking for a simple yet effective way to create a APEX standards document I strongly suggest you get a copy of his presentation (I'm going to see if he'll allow me to post a copy here).

  - [John Scott](http://jes.blogs.shellprompt.net/) (Apex Evangelists): Unfortunately I wasn't able to see any of his presentations but I heard they were really good, I'll have to get a copy of his slides and white papers later on.
