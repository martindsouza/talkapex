Dear Readers,

It's been a while (over 4 months) since I've posted a technical article on this blog. After presenting at [ODTUG KScope](http://kscope12.com/) this summer I've been really busy working at [ClariFit](http://www.clarifit.com/) and with other commitments. During the past four months there have been many times where I would have loved to roll up my sleeves and write a few articles but unfortunately other priorities took over.

The rest of my 2011 calendar is filling up quickly and I hope to squeeze in a few more articles by the end of the year. Here's what you can expect for the remainder of 2011:&nbsp; 

*   Free Ask the [ClariFit Experts Webinar](http://www.clarifit.com/1/post/2011/11/the-ask-the-clarifit-experts-webinar-has-been-rescheduled.html) on Wednesday December 14th at 1:30 PM EST. _Note: it's still not to late to submit an APEX or PL/SQL question. Check the link for more info on how to submit questions and register._
*   Two free plug-ins to be launched this week (actually one will be today!)
*   Guest blog post on [All Things Oracle](http://www.allthingsoracle.com/) about the [Expert Oracle Application Express Plugins](http://goo.gl/089zi) book.
*   Last but not least, (time permitting of course) a few APEX related articles. I have a very large list to write about and really look forward to dig into them.
