I'm really excited about my presentation at the Calgary Oracle User Group ([COUG](http://coug.ab.ca/)) on April 19th. I gave a presentation there three years ago and it'll be nice to give a talk "on home turf" again.

Here's the information about the presentation:

**Title:** Common Questions DBA have about APEX

**Abstract:** DBAs have many responsibilities managing the databases in their organizations. The introduction of Oracle Application Express (APEX) has added some more items to their already demanding list of tasks. This presentation will answer some of the common questions DBAs have about APEX.

APEX items to be discussed include: development best practices, release management, automatic backups, and web server configurations. This presentation is also relevant to developers and they are encouraged to attend.

**Date/Time/Location:**
April 19th 8:30am (registration starts at 8:00 am)

[Suncor Energy Centre (West Tower)](http://g.co/maps/kw523)
150 6th Avenue SW
17th floor â€“ Room A/B

I will also be giving away a few things at the end of my talk. [Apress](http://www.apress.com/) has been very generous and donated a copy of each of my [books](http://www.talkapex.com/p/books.html) and [ODTUG](http://www.odtug.com/) has donated a lot of really cool swag to help promote the best Oracle conference in the world, [Kscope 12](http://www.kscope12.com/).

Hope to see you there!

Martin
