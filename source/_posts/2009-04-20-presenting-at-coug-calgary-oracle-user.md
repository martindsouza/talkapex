I'll be giving a presentation on APEX at the Calgary Oracle User Group (COUG) on May 28th at 8:00 am. For those of you in Calgary it will be at 17 B/C on the 17th floor of the Petro-Canada west tower (Corner of 1st and 6th ave).

Please see [www.coug.ab.ca](http://www.coug.ab.ca) for more information.

I'll post a reminder a week before the presentation.
