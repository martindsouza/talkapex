ODTUG is hosting it's APEX focused APEXposed conference in Montreal this fall from September 11-12\. The [speaker list](http://odtugapextraining.com/presenters.html) is loaded with experts from around the <u>world</u> who will present on a wide variety of APEX and SQL Developer topics. The list includes 3 Oracle Product Managers (APEX / SQL Developer), 6 ACE and ACE Directors, and some other excellent presenters. To put some perspective on this list of presenters, there's only 14 ACE/ACE Directors in Canada and 375 world wide. Having 6 ACE/ACEDs coming to Montreal is a great opportunity to learn from them.

On a personal note, I'll be giving two talks on [APEX + HTML5](http://odtugapextraining.com/presentations.html#dsouzaapex), and [APEX Plugins](http://odtugapextraining.com/presentations.html#dsouzaplugins). I gave the HTML 5 presentation this summer at Kscope 12 but I'll be adding some new parts to it. The plugins presentation will go over how to create a plugin from scratch to help you and your team build your own APEX plugins.

For more information and to register go to [http://odtugapextraining.com](http://odtugapextraining.com/). If you register before August 15th you can take advantage of the early bird rate for only $399! This is a steal for the amount of information that you'll learn and the opportunity to ask the experts any of your APEX questions. To make things even more compelling if you use the code _CLARIFIT_ you will save an additional $50 off your registration cost.

For those that are coming from out of town (Toronto, Ottawa, Quebec City, Southern US, etc) ODTUG has secured a preferred rate at Le St.Martin. For more information go to [http://odtugapextraining.com/Location.html](http://odtugapextraining.com/Location.html) and scroll to the bottom.

I really hope that the Oracle community in Canada takes advantage of this opportunity. I'm not sure how often we'll get such an amazing list of presenters and presentations in our own back yard. See you there!
