ODTUG will be hosting an APEX webinar on Monday, Oct 19th at 12:00pm EDT. The webinar is about something that several key members of the APEX community have been working on that is "_from the community, for the community_". **I strongly recommend that everyone attend this webinar.&nbsp;**

I can't say anything more than the above statement and all will be revealed in the webinar. Registration is free, and you can register using [this link](https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/5033519521597802241).
