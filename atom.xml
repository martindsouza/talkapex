    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ll be at <a href="http://www.alliance-conference.com" target="_blank" rel="external">HEUG Alliance 2017</a> in Las Vegas next week. I’ll be giving a presentation on APEX with fellow <a href="insum.ca">Insum</a> colleagues Christian Larocque and <a href="https://twitter.com/InsumSmartel" target="_blank" rel="external">Sylvain Martel</a> called <em>From student systems to admin systems, one tool : Oracle APEX.</em> The goal of this presentation is to highlight the advantages of using Oracle APEX for higher education institutions.</p>
<p>This will be my first time attending Alliance and I found it difficult to plan my schedule using the existing site. I wasn’t able to easily search all the presentation information at once and on a per time slot basis. APEX to the rescue! We created a simple <a href="https://demo.insum.ca/ords/f?p=124" target="_blank" rel="external">APEX scheduling application</a> which allows attendees to easily see all the different session slots and search on all the presentations for each slot. For those that have never seen or used APEX before this application shows how easy and quick it is to get a very useful application up and running in a short period of time.</p>
<p>For those attending Alliance 2017 and want to learn more about APEX we’re offering free “Ask the Expert” sessions. To book a time with one of our experts register <a href="http://info.insum.ca/meet-integration-expert-alliance17" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>.</p>

<p>I couldn’t find how to create a custom class in the documents (as the help suggests). Using the pre-defined classes as an example I was able to create a custom class for a new color for my calendar. The following is an example of a custom APEX calendar class:</p>

    <title>How to Run Remote SQL Scripts in SQLcl</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the past few years of developing open source PL/SQL tools I’ve learned that one of the key things to make a project successful is have a frictionless install process. Node.js does this very well with their Node Package Manager (<code>npm</code>). Currently there is no largely adopted solution like <code>npm</code> for Oracle tools so one must usually provide a downloadable zip file containing the code along with installation instructions.</p>
<p>Recently I found out that <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sqlcl/overview/index.html" target="_blank" rel="external">SQLcl</a> (and I think <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/instant-client/index-097480.html" target="_blank" rel="external">SQL*Plus 12.1</a>) support running remote SQL scripts. The following is an example of running a remote script from SQLcl:</p>
<figure class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">SQL&gt; @https://gist.githubusercontent.com/martindsouza/91742f28c39ed2d41d35d80b6c4cc4c1/raw/d0f28ab7e8af5f64629ad480bad570764cece543/test.sql</div><div class="line">hello from github</div><div class="line">SQL&gt;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>The above script is a very simple one: <code>prompt hello from github</code> which can be adapted to contain a full install process.</p>
<p>The nice thing about running remote SQL scripts is that no ACL settings are required on the server nor SSL certificates since the client (i.e. your machine) is making the web request. The bad thing about this is that it opens the door for a lot of vulnerability potentials. <strong>It’s recommended to always review the script before running it.</strong></p>

    <title>Using Pivot for Aggregations</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Suppose you had a requirement in which you needed to return one row which had two columns. The two columns would contain the number of employees in the two different departments. This sounds like a trivial problem to solve but isn’t as easy when you get to coding it.</p>
<p>One way to do this is to use <code>case</code> statements in the aggregation function such as :</p>
<figure class="highlight sql"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div><div class="line">7</div><div class="line">8</div><div class="line">9</div><div class="line">10</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line"><span class="keyword">select</span></div><div class="line">  <span class="keyword">count</span>(<span class="keyword">case</span> <span class="keyword">when</span> d.dname = <span class="string">'ACCOUNTING'</span> <span class="keyword">then</span> <span class="number">1</span> <span class="keyword">else</span> <span class="literal">null</span> <span class="keyword">end</span>) acct_dept_cnt,</div><div class="line">  <span class="keyword">count</span>(<span class="keyword">case</span> <span class="keyword">when</span> d.dname = <span class="string">'RESEARCH'</span> <span class="keyword">then</span> <span class="number">1</span> <span class="keyword">else</span> <span class="literal">null</span> <span class="keyword">end</span>) rsch_dept_cnt</div><div class="line"><span class="keyword">from</span> emp e, dept d</div><div class="line"><span class="keyword">where</span> <span class="number">1</span>=<span class="number">1</span></div><div class="line">  <span class="keyword">and</span> e.deptno = d.deptno</div><div class="line">;</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">ACCT_DEPT_CNT  RSCH_DEPT_CNT</div><div class="line">3              5</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Another neat way to do this is to use the <code>pivot</code> function:<br><figure class="highlight sql"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div><div class="line">7</div><div class="line">8</div><div class="line">9</div><div class="line">10</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line"><span class="keyword">select</span></div><div class="line">  acct_dept_cnt,</div><div class="line">  rsch_dept_cnt</div><div class="line"><span class="keyword">from</span> (</div><div class="line">  <span class="keyword">select</span> e.deptno, d.dname</div><div class="line">  <span class="keyword">from</span> emp e, dept d</div><div class="line">  <span class="keyword">where</span> <span class="number">1</span>=<span class="number">1</span></div><div class="line">    <span class="keyword">and</span> e.deptno = d.deptno)</div><div class="line"><span class="keyword">pivot</span> (<span class="keyword">count</span>(deptno) <span class="keyword">as</span> dept_cnt <span class="keyword">for</span> (dname) <span class="keyword">in</span> (<span class="string">'ACCOUNTING'</span> <span class="keyword">as</span>  acct, <span class="string">'RESEARCH'</span> <span class="keyword">as</span> rsch))</div><div class="line">;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>In this example they both have the same explain plan as shown below. If using on larger / more complex data sets it would be a good idea to compare the explain plans for both queries to see if there’s performance gain between the two.</p>

This technique used an <code>execute immediate</code> function to reference a given package variable. Another alternative at the time was to create individual <code>get</code> functions for each variable.</p>
<p>Starting in Oracle 12c you can directly use PL/SQL in SQL and thus reference package variables in SQL. The following example shows how:</p>

Tried “Global Page - Static region” but jQuery isn’t loaded yet</em></p>
<p>The answer isn’t as straight forward as you think. Most people are used to referencing web files (JavaScript and CSS files) on <code>Page 0</code> from legacy APEX 4. As Kim hinted at in his question this isn’t always the best thing to do.</p>
<p>In APEX 5 there’s a specific area dedicated to reference custom web files. It’s not the easiest thing to find at first (it takes me a few tries to find it sometimes if I haven’t used it in a while).</p>

    <title>New Blog Platform Based on Markdown and Git</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you’ve followed this blog for a while you’ll notice that I had a significant drop in articles over the past year. So much so that I went from 35 posts in 2015 to just 4 posts in 2016. They’re various reasons for the reduction of posts which all came down to time, more specifically the lack of it.</p>
<p>I realized that I had the time to write the <em>content</em> for posts but I didn’t have the time to deal with all the formatting that was required on the <a href="blogger.com">blogger.com</a> platform (which used to host <a href="talkapex.com">talkapex.com</a>). It’s a great platform when writing basic text articles however when adding code samples it becomes an absolute pain to manage code formatting, especially editing an existing post.</p>
<p>Since working on many open source projects I’ve discovered <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" target="_blank" rel="external">Markdown</a> which is an easy-to-write plain text format that has special syntax for developers. If you’ve never used it I highly recommend that you look into it as it’ll change how you write technical documentation.</p>
<p>Over the weekend I moved this blog from the Blogger platform to <a href="https://hexo.io" target="_blank" rel="external">Hexo</a> and its now hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Github Pages</a>. This allows me to quickly write my blog posts in Markdown, manage the entire blog as a git repository on Github, and use Github Pages to host the site. If I find some time I’ll try to write about the migration process.</p>
<p>A few notes on the new <a href="talkapex.com">talkapex.com</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Older posts may not be formatted correctly. I’m working towards cleaning them as time permits</li>
<li>Comments were not retained and the site is using a new comment platform: <a href="https://disqus.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Disqus</a></li>
<li>Tags have all been cleaned up</li>
<li>All the old URLs should work</li>
<li>If you need to reference a comment or view the old site you can do so <a href="http://apex-smb.blogspot.ca" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If you do find something out of place or a broken link let me know or leave a comment on the article.</em></p>
<p>Going forward I’m hoping to write a lot of new posts quickly with this platform and time will tell if this migration solved the goal of allowing me to write more in 2017.</p>
<p><em>Special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/fuzziebrain" target="_blank" rel="external">Adrian Png</a> for introducing me to Hexo</em></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At ODTUG <a href="http://kscope15.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Kscope 15</a> last year I gave a presentation about APEX plugins. During the presentation I built a plugin from scratch to control my <a href="https://nest.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Nest Thermostat</a>. Everything went well until I did a live demo connecting the APEX plugin with my home Nest. I forgot to enable a service and unfortunately the demo didn’t work.</p>
<p>I recently gave a talk to the Vancouver Oracle User Group on <a href="http://martindsouza.github.io/pres-apex-ent-dev/#/" target="_blank" rel="external">APEX and the Future of Enterprise Development</a>. During this presentation I pre-recorded a video of APEX controlling my home Nest to highlight that APEX can work with the Internet of Things (IoT).</p>
<p>There has been some interest to see this in action so I have included a copy of the video below. On the right is a Nest plugin that I wrote for APEX, the left is the Nest app on an Android tablet, and in the center is the actual Nest.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This article is for people looking for help with the ClariFit From/To Date Picker</em>.</p>
<p>I’m currently in the process of updating some of the plugins I created for ClariFit to support APEX 5.0. As part of these changes some additional things are happening, mainly listing the plugins in the new <a href="http://apex.world/" target="_blank" rel="external">apex.world</a> site and moving the plugins ownership over to <a href="https://github.com/OraOpenSource" target="_blank" rel="external">OraOpenSource</a>.</p>
<p>The first plugin that has been moved/updated is the ClariFit From/To Date Picker. The plugin is now called OraOpenSource From/To Date Picker and is hosted <a href="https://github.com/OraOpenSource/apex-plugin-from-to-datepicker" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>. To help with backwards compatibility the plugin’s internal name has remained the same. This means that upgrades will be seamless.</p>
<p>Please post all bugs and enhancement requests on the project’s <a href="https://github.com/OraOpenSource/apex-plugin-from-to-datepicker/issues" target="_blank" rel="external">issue page</a>.</p>
<p>The next plugin that will be updated is the ClariFit Dialog (to be called OraOpenSource Dialog). It is currently being tested and will be officially released pending any major bugs. If you’d like any other ClariFit plugins updated to APEX 5.0 please leave a comment and I’ll look into it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you were at Oracle Open World a few weeks ago you may have missed that the <a href="http://archive.skem1.com/Campaigner/Public/t.show?9331d--5txha-19v43px8&amp;_v=2" target="_blank" rel="external">ODTUG Board of Directors election results</a> were posted.</p>
<p>The newly elected directors are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/opal_epm" target="_blank" rel="external">Opal Alapat</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/dbaontap" target="_blank" rel="external">Danny Bryant</a></li>

<li><a href="https://twitter.com/martindsouza" target="_blank" rel="external">Martin D’Souza</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I first must thank all the people that voted for me again this year. It means a lot that I have the support of the APEX and Oracle communities</p>
<p>They’re a few board members who will not be returning next year. They all have done a lot for ODTUG and its members.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/monty_latiolais" target="_blank" rel="external">Monty Latiolais</a><ul>
<li>Monty has been the President of ODTUG for the past few years. He’s done an amazing job leading the organization. Monty’s lasting legacy at ODTUG will be the <a href="http://www.odtug.com/p/cm/ld/fid=127" target="_blank" rel="external">Leadership Program</a>. He took a risk trying it out and it has been a very big success helping develop leaders within the ODTUG community.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/dschleis" target="_blank" rel="external">David Schleis</a><ul>
<li>David has helped re-energize the traditional developer and DBA communities. Over the past two years he helped merged them into one united “database” community. I look forward to David to continue help out with the database community in the coming years.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/miaurman" target="_blank" rel="external">Mia Urman</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I also need to say a special thank you to the current board for supporting me over the past year. Last year was a very difficult time for me personally and they all stepped up and supported me along the way. This is something I will never forget and will always be thankful for.</p>
<p>As ODTUG has a six year term limit for directors, this will be my last two years. I look forward to making them as good as the first four. If you have any feedback or things you’d like to see happen within the community please let me know.</p>
<p>– Martin</p>

I’ll be giving a presentation about APEX 5 and the new <a href="http://apex.world/" target="_blank" rel="external">apex.world</a> site.<br>FAQs I’ve received about this meetup:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does it cost anything? <em>No, it’s entirely free</em></li>
<li>What should I bring? <em>Yourself. Some people like to bring their laptop to try things out at the same time.</em></li>
<li>Is this a sales pitch: <em>No, it’s by the APEX community, for the APEX community.</em></li>
<li>Will only APEX items be covered? <em>Primarily we’ll be talking about APEX but may deviate a bit in the future to cover some SQL, PL/SQL, and web technologies. These topics are all relevant for APEX developers.</em></li>
<li>Where can I get one of the cool APEX stickers I see everyone has on Twitter? <em>At the meetup. I’ve got a whole stack to give away.</em></li>

Paid ODTUG members can cast their ballot between Oct 6th - Oct 27th. If you are a paid member you will get an email with the link, username, and voter id.</p>
<p>I am running for the ODTUG Board of Directors and I am looking for your support to continue to help the ODTUG community for another two years.</p>
<p>Here is my official campaign statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the past four years, I have had the privilege to represent the Oracle APEX Community as a Director for ODTUG. I have made the decision to run again this year for the ODTUG Board and am looking for your support in doing so.</p>
<p>During my four-year tenure, I have been involved in several committees within ODTUG that have helped bring conferences around the world, improved marketing initiatives, and organized developer contests.</p>
<p>I have been able to build strong relationships with other ODTUG Board Members, Oracle employees, and many developers in the APEX community. These relationships have allowed me to be a liaison between all three groups and help relay ideas and opportunities to the appropriate parties. I hope to continue to be able to facilitate open communication over the next two years.</p>
<p>I am looking for your vote to continue as an ODTUG Board Member to represent developers within one of the world’s largest Oracle user groups. Thank you in advance for your support.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thank you in advance,</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Each year the Oracle APEX community gets together at Oracle Open World (OOW) to have a few beers and catch up. This is a great informal event and its your chance to network with a lot of people in the APEX community and meet some of the gurus and members of the core APEX development team.</p>
<p>We’ll be having the annual APEX OOW Meetup at <a href="http://www.johnnyfoleys.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Johnny Foleys</a> on Tuesday, October 27th at 7:30 onwards. We’ve been their a few times now and it is a really fun night since they have duelling pianos later on in the evening. Don’t show up too late or it may be tough to get in.</p>
